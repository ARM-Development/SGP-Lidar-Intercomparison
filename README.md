# ARM SGP Lidar Intercomparison
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility is preparing to host a Lidar Intercomparison Campaign at its Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Oklahoma. This effort aims to evaluate and benchmark the performance of ARM’s diverse suite of lidar systems under a range of atmospheric conditions.

ARM operates a wide variety of lidar instruments across its fixed and mobile facilities, including ceilometers (CL31), micropulse lidars (MPL), Doppler lidars, Raman lidars, and high-spectral-resolution lidars (HSRL). The intercomparison will also feature new systems, such as the CL61 ceilometer and a miniMPL UHD.

This repository shall serve as a central area for the different teams working on the analysis to share codes, results, and more.
