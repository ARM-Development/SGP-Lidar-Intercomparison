# IO Scripts and Examples
This IO area is to house scripts related to reading, standardizing, and writing lidar datasets.  Currently, it has a script for downloading all the relevant datastreams for a particular date range and a Notebook that does something similar along with plotting the data up.  This area will be expanded as needed going forward.
